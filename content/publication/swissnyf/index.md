abstract: Safe execution of policies is crucial for an autonomous system. A popular choice for safety guarantees is CBF(Control Barrier Function). Traditional control barrier functions rely on explicit knowledge of the system dynamics and constraints. Hence We propose LatentCBF (LCBF), acontrol barrier function definition on the latent space of the agentâ€™s observation. LCBFs exploit the properties of deep neural networks to learn a representation of the system used to construct a barrier function. This function acts as a safety constraint that the control signal must satisfy, regardless ofthe complex system dynamics and uncertainties. By learning this constraint in a latent space, LCBFs have the potential to enable the safe operation of complex systems in a wide range of applications, from autonomous driving to robotics and beyond.
