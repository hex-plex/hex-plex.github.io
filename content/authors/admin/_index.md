I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research 
I am senior undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi persuing Electrical Engineering. My interests encompasses but not limited to Representation learning and Embodied AI. My research work has been in developing systems and agents which benefit or rely on these algorithms.

I have joined [John Dolan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/)'s [Argo AI Lab](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/argo-ai-center/) at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University working on Safe Autonomous Navigation.

Actively working under [Dr. Shishir Kolathaya](https://shishirny.github.io/), IISc, bangalore at [Stochlab](https://stochlab.github.io/) on Different Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Quadrupeds.

Previsously I worked under [Dr. Pratik Chattopadhyay](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/pratikcse/) developing Generative Adverserial Networks to generate occluded pose in the whole Gait Cycle of a human subject.

Besides Floating point values I like `strings` on my guitar to play a few tunes.
