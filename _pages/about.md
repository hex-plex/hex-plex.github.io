Hi there! I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) working on alignment and optimization of language models using Reinforcement learning. My interests encompasses but not limited to Representation learning and Embodied AI. My research work has been in developing systems and agents which benefit or rely on these algorithms. I completed my undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi.

Previuosly, I worked with [Qin Lin](https://qinlincmu.github.io/) and [John Dolan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/) at [Argo AI Lab](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/argo-ai-center/) at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University working on Safe Autonomous Navigation. Prior to which I wirked under [Dr. Shishir Kolathaya](https://shishirny.github.io/), IISc, bangalore at [Stochlab](https://stochlab.github.io/) on Different Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Quadrupeds.
