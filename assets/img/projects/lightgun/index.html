<p>Bored in the quarantine period, revisiting my old video games with light gun inspired an idea of light gun with a LCD display , I went on to build it mainly as a android package as it would be more accessable to anyone. Then ended up using a Raspberry Pi as a standalone device to enable it’s use accross many platforms and devices.<br></p>

<p><strong>The Explanation for the working can be found in <a href="https://github.com/hex-plex/Light-Gun/blob/master/EXPLANATION.md" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">EXPLANATION.md</a></strong></p>

<h2 id="glimpse">Glimpse:</h2>
<p>This is the glimpse of the prototype made with Raspberry pi on a toy gun with all the number-munching done on the Raspberry and transmites messages to the local server through bluetooth. The previous method of running the proccessing and the actions is documented in <strong>Win-Py</strong> directory.<br></p>

<br><br><br></p>
<p align="left">This is a prototype of the light gun with a camera module attached onto a toy-gun and with a Raspberry pi 3 b+ (unneccessary I know) and a 7.4 V li-ion battery, regulated with a buck converter to which two switches are connected on the Raspi's interrupt pins.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br>
This is the display setup with 4 IR-LEDs attached to the corners of the display which makes it very easy for detection in a wide range of lighting conditions.&lt;hr/&gt;<br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>And after Installation the main code using <a href="https://github.com/hex-plex/Light-Gun/tree/master/Raspi-c" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Raspi</a> version or <a href="https://github.com/hex-plex/Light-Gun/tree/master/Win-py" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Local</a> version, continue using it according to the guide lines for the same which is present in their respective folders itself.</p>

<p>The Modules then should create a virtual mouse and start following the edge vector of the camera module.
The following is a demonstration of it in action…. (<img class="emoji" title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f605.png" height="20" width="20"> coming up shortly, as I am fixing few deviation errors.)</p>

<h2 id="contribution">Contribution</h2>
<p>Any kind of Contribution is always welcomed. The rules for any Contribution for now is Non existent as I am the only one working on it and I have not really structurized the project so well as mostly in its prototyping stage, So its not possible to do a lot(Anyways feel free to report any errors or bugs <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> ), Any Idea for a better implementation is also welcomed.</p>
