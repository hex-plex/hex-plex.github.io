<p>Original code for the paper <strong>“BGaitR-Net: Occluded Gait Sequence reconstruction with temporally constrained model for gait recognition”</strong> under Prof. Pratik Chattopadhyay.</p>

<p>This work proposes simple BiDirectional Filtering of the latent vectors of The silhouettes. TimeSeries Data of the latent space is been filter for reconstruction using a simple Bi-LSTM trained with A sophisticated method proposed in the paper.
The Conversion of the Spatio Data to latent space was done using a  conditional Variational AutoEncoder.
We have used a 3 Datasets : for training 2 namely, CASIA-B, OU-ISIR large population, and testing 1 namely, TumIITKGP.</p>

<p><em>A conditional GAN based approach is also been presented in code</em></p>

<h2 id="proposed-approach">Proposed approach</h2>

<p>We have used a Model based approach for feature extraction using <strong>Temporally constrained Kmeans Clustering</strong> and <strong>Short Path in a Weighted Graph</strong> for assigning Keypose for the Sequence even in case of Occlusion. This achieved substantially better results</p>
