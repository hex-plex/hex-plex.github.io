The motive of this gym is to allow us to test out and develop Algorithms for such a MultiAgent System. This is further used to learn heirarchial planning of such a MultiAgent systems to develop a generalized swarm behaviour in the robots (i.e., Colabortively working towards achieving a objective). This is an project that is being developed under the RoBoReG division of the Robotics Club, IIT Varanasi.\nHere the robot is designed in SolidWorks and being Simulated in pybullet.\n Here the robots where controlled to form into this specified constellation.\nIOTA \nThis is a cost effective modular robot platform developed by us, This contains two docking plates enabling it to dock with other robots at those locations. This has got a very antique WW1 tank inspired designed which allows the bot too with enough traction when used with catpillar tracks.\nFor more info on the bot hardware and designs please visit this page here or doc \nInstallation To install the latest features one could clone and install like so.\ngit clone https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/gym-iOTA cd gym-iOTA pip install -e gym-iOTA  else for stable releases. the below would work fine.\npip install gym-iOTA  Depedencies  gym pybullet opencv-python Pillow  Usage This environment can be accessed using gym api, and a small demo scipt is given below.\ndemo.py import gym import gym_iOTA env = gym.make('iOTA-v0', render=True, ## This runs the simulator in GUI mode no_of_modules=10, ## This spawns so many no of robots no_of_clusters=10, ## This is for subdividing the total no of robots in cluster for efficient accessing. arena=(2,2), ## This sets the dimension of the forseeable space for the system low_control=True, ## This flag enables the low level control of the bot to the user. ) while True: action = np.ones((env.no_of_modules, 4)) ## Where for each row we have four velocities dock = np.zeros( (env.no_of_modules, env.no_of_modules)) ## This is the adjancy matrix storing all the docking relationships observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action, dock) observation ## This is the coordinates+orientation of each bot env.render(mode='cluster') ## This would return the image and even render if was not in GUI mode earlier. if done: break env.close() ## simply removes all the docks and the bots and disconnects from the simulator.  Objective The objective of the environment is to use these robots to push the box from one side of the arena to the other. The below is a dry run with classical localization algorithm - Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm.\n Here the swarm of bots try to localize the box in the 3D environment\n The Reward function is defined as the negetive of the distance between the position of the cube to the end point which is on the other side of the arena.\n Info This section contains details about the environment API\u0026rsquo;s and utils available in it for developement.\nlow_control (Boolean) : rather confusing term is present to allow the user to get low level control of individual bot that is the to set the desired velocities of each wheel touching the ground. else the environment would by itself control the robot and listen to the planner that plans trajectory to the given setpoint.\nenv.action_space (gym.Box) : The action space varies if one chooses low_control to be True or False, if the low_control is set True then action space is vector of velocities of 4 wheel for each robot. i.e., action_space shape = (no_of_modules, 4)  for each row [right_forward_wheel, left_forward_wheel, right_back_wheel, left_back_wheel] of that bot.\nenv.dockMatrix (np.ndarray) : This contains all the joints or dockings that exist in the system, this a array containing if a bot is connected with another. i.e., dockMatrix shape = (no_of_modules, no_of_modules) So if env.dockMatrix[i][j] = 0 then it means there is no joint or docking between robot number i and j. similarly if env.dockMatrix[i][j] = 1 then it means these two robots are docked together. note : env.dockMatrix[i][j] = env.dockMatrix[j][i] are same as they can have only one constrain between them. And no self docking is possible i.e., env.dockMatrix[i][i] = 1 is not possible. We pass a similar matrix to env.step function where-in we denote new joints that we want to make.\nenv.observation_space (gym.Box) : The observation space is simply vector of position and orientation of each robot. i.e., observation_space shape = (no_of_modules, 6) for each row [x_coor, y_coor, z_coor, roll, pitch, yaw] of that bot.\nenv.iotas (class iOTA) : This is a list of robots that have been spawned into the simulator and gives us individual control over each robot. A list API\u0026rsquo;s and variables are given here.  The index of each robot in the list the robot number assigned to it which is the convection we use through out.\nenv.step (gym.Env.step) : This takes in two inputs one action being the env.action_space and a dock matrix similar to the env.dockingMatrix  it returns the usual  observation, reward, done, info\nenv.render (np.ndarray) : This returns the image of the top view of the arena. The image is also rendered using PIL\u0026rsquo;s Image class if mode = 'human'\nenv.close (gym.Env.close): This simply removes all the joints and dockings and removes all the bodies and closes the connection to the physics server.\nThe Team  Somnath Sendhil Kumar \n Surabhit Gupta\n R Tharun Gowda\n Kritika Bansal\n  Mentors  Lokesh Krishna\n Niranth Sai\n  References [1] Swarmbot-Hardware: Mondada, F., Pettinaro, G.C., Guignard, A. et al.

I have used [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50] number of modules to carryout the tests.\nOne may find the Tensorboard log files here:\nlog_kilobot [Drive Link] (403MB)\nand the Model Weights for each parameters here:\ncheckpoint_kilobot [Drive Link] (63.3MB)\nGraph Problem The below table is based on the number of modules used but for result tabulation I am considering [5, 10, 20, 50] number of modules. To infer many insights of the algorithm in hand.\nPlease click on the image to zoom in\n   Model Trained on \\ Model Run on 10 20 50     10      20 -  -   50 - -      The policies trained on 20 and 50 module system is completely random in sense it just goes forward. We can see clearly the policy trained with 10 modules have yield a very good amount of coordination between each other that is the critic model taking in the input image of the system is able to specify the bots and guide them, Hence a very good amount of generalization is found when we use this model with system with different number of modules as can be seen with the 20 module system but the non stationarity of a higher order system makes it complex for the critic to reward or give baseline to the actor, As the\n The order of the reward changes drastically. The Reading from the histogram becomes Muddy. The correlation of a reward to action of a single agent reduces drastically.   Hence the Model trained with 10 modules is not able to generalize to the 50 module system, BUT It looks more promising than the policy trained for the 50 module system itself, hence a curiculum learning based approach seems promising to solve such a transfer learning problem.\nPlots for Training with 10 modules    Actor Loss Critic Loss Reward            For 5 modules The system can\u0026rsquo;t comphensate for the negetive reward got by using fuel as the reward got for graphing is much smaller in order than it that it chooses to be stagnent.  Localization Problem Here the task was much easier but the training didnt yield any satisfactory result as.\n there were a lot of non stationarities and the fact the system was modelled based on a fashion which couldn\u0026rsquo;t extend more than a small system of at best 10 modules [1]. And the fact that the reward of localization couldnt exceed the negetive reward for moving the bot that is the bots choose to stand still to save fuel over exploring in most of the senarios.  Below are few runs with [10, 25] Number of modules.\n   Localization trained for small n(=10) Localization trained for big n(=25)          Here it is clearly visible that because of randomness and the fact more number of can cover a larger space of the system exploration is much easier than being greedy to stay at a point and save fuel.\nAcknowledgment To Center for Computing and Information Services, IIT (BHU) varanasi to provide the computational power, i.e., The Super Computer on which I was able to train for over 10 Million Timesteps for about 1.5 months.\nFor any other query feel free to reachout.\nReferences [1] Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Swarm Systems [arXiv:1709.06011v1] [cs.MA] 18 Sep 2017\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8443239b3870f8de2b835cb85153c56","permalink":"https://hex-plex.github.io/project/kilobot-multiagentrl/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/kilobot-multiagentrl/","section":"project","summary":"Deep MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning on \"KiloBot\" by Havard University","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","MultiAgent Systems","Deep Learning","OpenAI gym","PyGame"],"title":"KiloBot MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Bored in the quarantine period, revisiting my old video games with light gun inspired an idea of light gun with a LCD display , I went on to build it mainly as a android package as it would be more accessable to anyone.

The libraries\npickle numpy cv2 pygame # Below are mostly available preinstalled in any python distribution socket BytesIO # from io in python3 or directly in python2 _thread # for python 3 and thread in python2  Which are quite rudimentary and neccessary part of the code.\nMultithreading Here I have use many threads to assure that no data is missed while any other calculation or process is running on the main thread as there might be some unwanted lag between inputs.Also another thread on mainmodel exists which take inputs from the user for pausing and resuming its learning session\nSockets I have used sockets to send data between scripts rather than using a instance of model and the pong env on the same script well that would work just fine (or better removing all the lag of communication) , but my goal was to make it more appealing and to make me learn more real life skills that is if I train a agent with raspberry pi ( or any other weaker mobile device for that matter ) as a part of the environment or in the environment a more viable option than running both simulation and the RL agent would be to do the computation and send in actions to it. This also gave me a good understanding about data compression and network security ,though here there is none used as it just accepts the first connection to the env.   with the use of socket one could manually control the environment with keyboard and also have a RL agent learning (half - Duplex).\nDemo To launch the env with mostly default values just running pong.py directly would start the server with default configs. Its always recommended to use its instance, apply your configuration you want it to run and start the server.\nfrom pong import Pong env = Pong( levelodiff=1, ## This is the level of the inbuilt AI that plays against you. ## Set it to 4 and chill out (really try it!!) the scale is 1-3 debug=False, ## If set to True it will print the stage the environment is in and info the data inputs and outputs render=False, ## It would render the image that is sent to the model, This slows down the process so not a good idea to use it. server=True, ## This is to set server mode on , if set false the environment will be no different from ordinary pong game. host=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, ## This is to specify where you want to host it, \u0026quot;\u0026quot; maps to local host \u0026quot;0.0.0.0\u0026quot; doesnt really map ## to your ip address yet port=12345 ## This your port no. of the connection. ) ## This is to just initiate the environment env.start()## This starts the env ie., hosts itself as per the given parameter and waits for a connection in async while continuing the game  To launch the RL agent running the mainmodel.py directly will run it in default config.  To customize to your config import and create an instance and run the client. \nfrom mainmodel import PolicyGradient ## This uses two hidden layer to out-put 2 probabilities agent = PolicyGradient( resume=False, ## This is usefull to continue training from previos checkpoint. render=True, ## This will render the image got through the socket,useful if model is in another computer host=None, ## If the value is None it trys to find a localhost , else specific host is to be provided as a str port=12345, ## default value is 12345 set is as required. hiddenUnits=250, ## This no of hiddenUnits in first layer depending on the dimension of input. batch_size=10, ## This is to set batch size for batch reiforcement learning rather than using single episode. learningRate=1e-3, ## This is to set learning rate gamma=0.99, ## This is to set gamma or the discount decayRate=0.99 ## This is decayRate for RMSprop ) ## This creates an instance of PolicyGradient algorithm as a client_socket agent.start() ## This starts the agent ie., connects to the server and communicates and learns from its experience.  Running them should launch the env and agent would start leaning. There is a propriety control in mainmodel.py which takes input in its terminal as\n \u0026lsquo;p\u0026rsquo; ==\u0026gt; Pausing/Resuming the training process \u0026lsquo;q\u0026rsquo; ==\u0026gt; Quit the training process , But this makes a Checkpoint as interrupt.p \u0026lsquo;ping\u0026rsquo; ==\u0026gt; This pings the pong server 10 times and returns the average time it took to send and receive packets. else with a better score of agent, the model is saved continuosly as save.p.  Fast-training I have experimented the whole thing with networking sockets and asynchronous methods limiting the training process to human level speed for which I have uploaded the pong-fast-train.tar.gz\ntar -xvzf pong-fast-train.tar.gz cd pong-fast python mainmodel.py mv save.p ../save.p  So this should train the model and save it into the main directory this should load the trained model in the main algo.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"9b914e97eb222fec53f7e061f664cf30","permalink":"https://hex-plex.github.io/project/pong-reinforcementlearning/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pong-reinforcementlearning/","section":"project","summary":"Implementation of Policy Gradient on self made Pong game.","tags":["Computer Vision","PyGame","Reinforcement Learning","Video Game"],"title":"Pong Reinforcement Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":["Somnath Kumar","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
