We have been able to answer 2 of the above.\nVisual odometry We have been able to modify the Viso2ROS to run with a less number of feature points and with reduced map foot print for easier localization with help of few apriltags, for global coordinates and not using the whole map. We also to utilize the MALI GPU of the onboard computer compiled opencv with OpenCL to get a slightly better performance in the framerate of the localization. There is not much more novelty introduced from our end.\nOptimal controller - RL Aided MPC With limited computation, running an onboard MPC with non-linear Dynamics will fail to provide responsive control. Another Famous approach is RL-based controllers, where the feedback is a learned approximation of an expert demonstration from something like an MPC. But these policies are many layers deep and make it difficult to run in constrained hardware. Shallower policies tend to approximate the dynamics a lot and learn a sub-optimal policy that fails to work in many scenarios that are not desirable in multi-agent systems.\nHence I propose use of a small RL policies output as the hot solution to the MPC. Conceptually its a very simple task but this requires a responsive pipeline for being able to execute at a desired Rate. Below is our pipeline in Simulation and in Hardware.\nI have used the gym-pybullet-drones, as the base environment for our drone. We have imported our designs into the environment, Along with parameters for the drone like Air Drag coefficients.\nFor the MPC I have used the mpc.pytorch library from locuslab. As this uses pytorch backend for computation and optimization. This increased the efficiency and drastically decreased train time from 2 hrs to 45 mins.\nFor the training I implemented a simple 3 layer deep policy implemented using Pytorch and I used simple Policy Gradient algorithm, I trained using Ray Library with multiple workers while extending the dimension of the control of the MPC for optimizing the Training Loop.\nWe have tried using both the linear and the non-linear dynamics of the MPC, we resorted on using the linear dynamics along with RL for better deployment keeping the hardware limitation in mind\nReward We have used a simple curriculum of running the RL based estimations of the optimal force values for each properllers. As a low level PID controller is running for maintaining the altitude altitude, our main goal was to learn the force value estimation directly from a expert policy like the mpc, and later we could work on how the RL algorithm would optimize hot solutions than estimating better optimal control inputs. This is a key difference as here it would not have to model higher non-linearity of the horizon while optimizing the hot solution to the MPC.\nLater in the curriculum we add and extra term for decreasing the number of iterations taken to converge by an MPC. This reward is given from the MPC node and is just taken along side the state reward given from the environment.\nHence our net Reward is as follows\n\nResults After training for 8000 episodes we reach a decent point with high enough reward and good amount of speculation to use our Policy with current Architecture. Below is the demonstration of the robot trying to trace a figure 8 using the current Control architecture.\ntracing the figure 8 while running at 70 Hz As it can be seen this is able to trace the given trajectory. Below is the example of the Optimization the MPC provides over the RL Estimations\nPolicy Estimations for significant angles of Rolls and Pitches MPC based optimization reducing the Unsafe values of the Thrusts for smoother long horizon performance A more analytic study shows the improvement in performance by the need of steps to converge the optimization and the rate of diverge or failure in optimizing the policy within the limit.\nFor feasible run time of the MPC we use a threshold of optimal 5 iterations and maximum of 10 iterations would allow use to run the Pipeline on our desired system. Here we are optimizing the trajectories within a certain amount of cost which are experimented for suiting both performance and efficiency.\nAs can be seen from the curve performance of Pipeline increases continuing to train it further hence a proportional correlation confirms the proof of concept.\nThe second metrics we are using the rate of failures in either not being able to find a solution or not converging before the 10 iterations threshold, as we have used the approximated linear dynamics of the Drone we are entitled to diverge in prediction of the future states and hence give an sub optimal response, We see this is also improved with the current architecture and is able to robustly work in a bigger configuration space.\nGiven the improvement of the performance against only MPC based control makes it a very good fit for our application. Currently hardware code structured would have to finalized as we would have to make utilize most of all the onboard computation for both the RL policy forward propagation and the MPC optimization. Hence we are working on modifing Mav_Control_RW for our needs to use a betaflight firmware as the lowlevel controller and communicated through MavLink.\nFuture works We are currently working on implementing the hardware pipline for feasible hardware results. And constantly estimating optimal parameters to run the pipe line with.\nAs Specified in the start of the post we are also trying to solve the problem of trajectory optimization of Multi-Agent systems for which we would be more than happy to collaborate or hear from you.\n","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"6bfaadc3a4f6775f83ae49b87f2c6899","permalink":"https://hex-plex.github.io/project/nanodrone-rlampc/","publishdate":"2021-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nanodrone-rlampc/","section":"project","summary":"Reinforcement Learning aided MPC for constrained systems","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Optimal Control","ROS"],"title":"NanoDrone RL Aided MPC","type":"project"},{"authors":["Somnath Kumar"],"categories":["Robotics","Competetions"],"content":"Flipkart Grid is a national robotics challenge that is organised by Flipkart annually. It is a distinguished event in which 2000+ teams representing different institutes participate from across the nation.\nGrid 3.0 is being organised by Flipkart this year and the problem statement requires a swarm of hardware bots to be built. Here is the link to this year’s problem statement-Flipkart Grid 3.0 - Robotics Challenge : Problem Statement\n(Building a swarm of bots with active communication for autonomous package sortation with a central monitoring system in an industrial environment.)\n Our team named “NoSignal” comprising 15 students with expertise across different fields has registered for the event and we are looking forward to ace the competition this year and bring laurels to our institute.\nWe just need your support to do it well!!\n  -- Recieved Rs.51,200 out of Rs.73000   Help us reach there!!.\nSupport Us  Our Voyage so far- We started by forming a team in 2020 to take part in Grid 2.0. It consisted of 3 novice juniors and 3 experienced seniors. The team worked hard and learned a lot of things through the event. The journey included sleepless nights, long brainstorming sessions and a lot of innovation and hard work.\nWe designed a novel hardware and implemented software algorithms to predict the positions and orientations of the gripper to grab various objects. Here are some results from our endeavor -\n Predicting grabbing points for a headphone           a b    Hardware at work in simulation The team, representing our prestigious institute, took part in Grid 2.0 last year and were able to make it to the national finals in our very first attempt at such a competition, among the top 3 teams from all over the nation. From then, it has only motivated us to proceed further and prepare ourselves for the next iteration of Flipkart.. Throughout the year, we have trained our team on various skill sets required for the real world deployment of robotics through various competitions and events. This has made our current team members better mentors and our incoming new members better roboticists. Thus we are now ready to embark upon the next big challenge with a bigger and a better team.\nCurrent Progress and Plan We are planning to solve the problem statement using very modest hardware and our innovative solutions. In this harsh time we are facing great difficulty in fabricating the robots due to lack of funds and collaboration space. For now we were able to solve a genuine amount of the problem statement while having built one prototype that is autonomously controlled by ROS.\n         a b    Our First Prototype  This is a modest hardware consisting of BO motors with encoders, Raspberry pi zero W (For Onboard computation), and a off shell Chassis with caster wheels. We are continuously testing out Mechanisms for Package Dropping.\nSwarm of robots moving around a Warehouse\nEven Before testing out our algorithms we test them on Gazebo (DARPA accepted simulator), And iterate to make better algorithms.

These are implemented in ROS so that we can deploy them directly on the hardware. My major contribution was to integrate these well established optimal control algorithms with the ROS framework of the Quadruped.\nMajority of the Optimal control do not have significant difference in performance in Hardware as I was unable to test them in many scenarios through the simulators.\nModel Predictive Control Inspired from [1] implemented the convex mpc for the quadruped. along with [2] a whole body impulse Controller which will help to trace the estimated foot forces estimated from the Controller. While the MPC uses an approximate Linear model of the quadruped. The whole body impulse controller considers the Floating base dynamics of the robot, while the MPC uses the Single Rigid body Dynamics.

As the rate is too slow and the difference between the state at the start of the optimization and current would be drastically different, I implemented towr to run parallely with estimation of the current state of the robot based on the control input of the previous optimized solution and the dynamics model of the robot solved to fetch the state at a future timestep.\nReinforcement Learning We are further working towards improving the performance of these algorithm by using Reinforcement Learning with formulations to work along side these algorithms and also in tandom with these algorithm.\nReferences [1]Dynamic Locomotion in the MIT Cheetah 3 Through Convex Model-Predictive Control, DOI: 10.1109/IROS.2018.8594448, Jared Di Carlo, Patrick Wensing, Benjamin Katz, Sangbae Kim\n[2]Highly Dynamic Quadruped Locomotion via Whole-Body Impulse Control and Model Predictive Control, Donghyun Kim, Jared Di Carlo, Benjamin Katz, Gerado Bledt, Sangbae Kim\n[3]Gait and Trajectory Optimization for Legged Systems Through Phase-Based End-Effector Parameterization, Alexander W.

This is further used to learn heirarchial planning of such a MultiAgent systems to develop a generalized swarm behaviour in the robots (i.e., Colabortively working towards achieving a objective). This is an project that is being developed under the RoBoReG division of the Robotics Club, IIT Varanasi.\nHere the robot is designed in SolidWorks and being Simulated in pybullet.\n Here the robots where controlled to form into this specified constellation.\nIOTA \nThis is a cost effective modular robot platform developed by us, This contains two docking plates enabling it to dock with other robots at those locations. This has got a very antique WW1 tank inspired designed which allows the bot too with enough traction when used with catpillar tracks.\nFor more info on the bot hardware and designs please visit this page here or doc \nInstallation To install the latest features one could clone and install like so.\ngit clone https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/gym-iOTA cd gym-iOTA pip install -e gym-iOTA  else for stable releases. the below would work fine.\npip install gym-iOTA  Depedencies  gym pybullet opencv-python Pillow  Usage This environment can be accessed using gym api, and a small demo scipt is given below.\ndemo.py import gym import gym_iOTA env = gym.make('iOTA-v0', render=True, ## This runs the simulator in GUI mode no_of_modules=10, ## This spawns so many no of robots no_of_clusters=10, ## This is for subdividing the total no of robots in cluster for efficient accessing. arena=(2,2), ## This sets the dimension of the forseeable space for the system low_control=True, ## This flag enables the low level control of the bot to the user. ) while True: action = np.ones((env.no_of_modules, 4)) ## Where for each row we have four velocities dock = np.zeros( (env.no_of_modules, env.no_of_modules)) ## This is the adjancy matrix storing all the docking relationships observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action, dock) observation ## This is the coordinates+orientation of each bot env.render(mode='cluster') ## This would return the image and even render if was not in GUI mode earlier. if done: break env.close() ## simply removes all the docks and the bots and disconnects from the simulator.

And no self docking is possible i.e., env.dockMatrix[i][i] = 1 is not possible. We pass a similar matrix to env.step function where-in we denote new joints that we want to make.\nenv.observation_space (gym.Box) : The observation space is simply vector of position and orientation of each robot. i.e., observation_space shape = (no_of_modules, 6) for each row [x_coor, y_coor, z_coor, roll, pitch, yaw] of that bot.\nenv.iotas (class iOTA) : This is a list of robots that have been spawned into the simulator and gives us individual control over each robot.

The index of each robot in the list the robot number assigned to it which is the convection we use through out.\nenv.step (gym.Env.step) : This takes in two inputs one action being the env.action_space and a dock matrix similar to the env.dockingMatrix  it returns the usual  observation, reward, done, info\nenv.render (np.ndarray) : This returns the image of the top view of the arena. The image is also rendered using PIL\u0026rsquo;s Image class if mode = 'human'\nenv.close (gym.Env.close): This simply removes all the joints and dockings and removes all the bodies and closes the connection to the physics server.\nThe Team  Somnath Sendhil Kumar \n Surabhit Gupta\n R Tharun Gowda\n Kritika Bansal\n  Mentors  Lokesh Krishna\n Niranth Sai\n  References [1] Swarmbot-Hardware: Mondada, F., Pettinaro, G.C., Guignard, A. et al.

This is partially inspired from the Turtlebot[2] but it must be kept in mind the algorithm has be able to model the two wheeled bot to even account for its self balancing action which was solved using accurate System Modelling[3].\nDesign The above is the bot in all its glory, I had built The Hardware before running simulations and testing out its stability as its quite an symmetrical and simple design. This surely resembles turtlebot but has a few changes. Basically the idea was to have a worthy replacement for a turtlebot to test out all the mapping and planning algorithms on it.\n After the construction it was quite easy to make a 3D design for the simulators. My Weapon of choice Phobos[4] and Blender.\nBelow is a simple design of the bot in blender.\nWith some Phobos magics 🎉🎉\nWe can set the parameters required for generating URDF of the bot.\nExporting it just makes the work run naturally with Gazebo, PyBullet and any other Simulator of choice. The below is a simple PID control on the Pitch of the Bot.\nYou can get the same output running the following in the terminal.\ngit clone https://github.com/hex-plex/PauciBot-Hardware.git cd PauciBot-Hardware python scripts/trial.py  Under-Development The Main objective was that I wanted to explore the Difficulties faced when taking the Project from simulation to reality and vice versa. The Main tool is ROS as its a well established community with most useful tools opensourced for all. Hence I would like to release The bot with a ROS package. I have been currently working on the same for the past few months.\nHope to see you there soon. : )\nComponents The whole body is made of Ply wood and solid wood. And the wheels are just off the shelf RC car wheels with a 11.1 V LiPo battery.\n  Arduino Mega 2560   I have used this for controlling the motor drivers and getting a Odometry and runnning a baseline self balancing algorithm.\n  Nvidia Jetson Nano 4GB   This is the ROS hardware Node on the Robot which communicates to a master on the localhost using UDP protocol. This is also used to give the neccesary computational power for onboard Computer Vision algorithms.

I have used [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50] number of modules to carryout the tests.\nOne may find the Tensorboard log files here:\nlog_kilobot [Drive Link] (403MB)\nand the Model Weights for each parameters here:\ncheckpoint_kilobot [Drive Link] (63.3MB)\nGraph Problem The below table is based on the number of modules used but for result tabulation I am considering [5, 10, 20, 50] number of modules. To infer many insights of the algorithm in hand.\nPlease click on the image to zoom in\n   Model Trained on \\ Model Run on 10 20 50     10      20 -  -   50 - -      The policies trained on 20 and 50 module system is completely random in sense it just goes forward. We can see clearly the policy trained with 10 modules have yield a very good amount of coordination between each other that is the critic model taking in the input image of the system is able to specify the bots and guide them, Hence a very good amount of generalization is found when we use this model with system with different number of modules as can be seen with the 20 module system but the non stationarity of a higher order system makes it complex for the critic to reward or give baseline to the actor, As the\n The order of the reward changes drastically. The Reading from the histogram becomes Muddy. The correlation of a reward to action of a single agent reduces drastically.   Hence the Model trained with 10 modules is not able to generalize to the 50 module system, BUT It looks more promising than the policy trained for the 50 module system itself, hence a curiculum learning based approach seems promising to solve such a transfer learning problem.\nPlots for Training with 10 modules    Actor Loss Critic Loss Reward            For 5 modules The system can\u0026rsquo;t comphensate for the negetive reward got by using fuel as the reward got for graphing is much smaller in order than it that it chooses to be stagnent.  Localization Problem Here the task was much easier but the training didnt yield any satisfactory result as.\n there were a lot of non stationarities and the fact the system was modelled based on a fashion which couldn\u0026rsquo;t extend more than a small system of at best 10 modules [1]. And the fact that the reward of localization couldnt exceed the negetive reward for moving the bot that is the bots choose to stand still to save fuel over exploring in most of the senarios.  Below are few runs with [10, 25] Number of modules.\n   Localization trained for small n(=10) Localization trained for big n(=25)          Here it is clearly visible that because of randomness and the fact more number of can cover a larger space of the system exploration is much easier than being greedy to stay at a point and save fuel.\nAcknowledgment To Center for Computing and Information Services, IIT (BHU) varanasi to provide the computational power, i.e., The Super Computer on which I was able to train for over 10 Million Timesteps for about 1.5 months.\nFor any other query feel free to reachout.\nReferences [1] Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Swarm Systems [arXiv:1709.06011v1] [cs.MA] 18 Sep 2017\n","date":1599091200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599091200,"objectID":"e8443239b3870f8de2b835cb85153c56","permalink":"https://hex-plex.github.io/project/kilobot-multiagentrl/","publishdate":"2020-09-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/kilobot-multiagentrl/","section":"project","summary":"Deep MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning on \"KiloBot\" by Havard University","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","MultiAgent Systems","Deep Learning","OpenAI gym","PyGame"],"title":"KiloBot MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"RL-based learning for a robotic arm to imitate a given hand in a image feed with handOfJustice as our environment\nTo Setup pip install gym-handOfJustice  else\ngit clone https://github.com/hex-plex/gym-handOfJustice cd gym-handOfJustice pip install -e .

I have made pong.py a environment which one can host either locally (localhost) or on 0.0.0.0 (LAN).Allowing to communicate to mainmodel.py which has to be connected to the same host and the same port.  I have used a simple socket connection to transfer data rather than a flask/django backend as they are based on it giving a advantage of speed of communication.  both the scripts have debug mode which allows one to see in which state or stage they are in. \nOutput  The one on the left is a RL agent trained for 3 days and the one on right is a hardcoded AI. This is noticible the they nearly have the same level of skills. Requirements This requires only few basic libraries it only runs on python3, rather a small update can make it compatible with python2. The libraries\npickle numpy cv2 pygame # Below are mostly available preinstalled in any python distribution socket BytesIO # from io in python3 or directly in python2 _thread # for python 3 and thread in python2  Which are quite rudimentary and neccessary part of the code.\nMultithreading Here I have use many threads to assure that no data is missed while any other calculation or process is running on the main thread as there might be some unwanted lag between inputs.Also another thread on mainmodel exists which take inputs from the user for pausing and resuming its learning session\nSockets I have used sockets to send data between scripts rather than using a instance of model and the pong env on the same script well that would work just fine (or better removing all the lag of communication) , but my goal was to make it more appealing and to make me learn more real life skills that is if I train a agent with raspberry pi ( or any other weaker mobile device for that matter ) as a part of the environment or in the environment a more viable option than running both simulation and the RL agent would be to do the computation and send in actions to it. This also gave me a good understanding about data compression and network security ,though here there is none used as it just accepts the first connection to the env.   with the use of socket one could manually control the environment with keyboard and also have a RL agent learning (half - Duplex).\nDemo To launch the env with mostly default values just running pong.py directly would start the server with default configs.
